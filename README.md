# AoC 2025 in Haskell
Merry Christmas everyone 🦌🎄🧑‍🎄🎁!. This repository contains my source code for
Advent of Code 2025 (in Haskell).

## Running the code
Add an `/inputs` directory to the project root and add your input files in there as `day01.txt` for example.
(or `day01_test.txt` for test input). To run the program, run `cabal run -- {day_number}` and add the `-ti` flag
if you want to use the test input as opposed to the normal puzzle input
